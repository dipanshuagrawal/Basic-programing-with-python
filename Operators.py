#Here we will be discussing about different type of operator that we can use in Python

#Arithmetics and Comparision Operators
a = 5+6;
b = 6-5;
c = 5*6;
d = 6/5;
e = 6%5;
f = 3**2;
g = (a==b);
h = (a>b);
i = (a>=b);
j = (a<b);
k = (a<=b);

#Bitwise and Logical Operators
a=34;
b=56;
#Give binary value of a.
bin(a);  

#Give binary value of b
bin(b);  

#AND operator
bin(a&b);  

#OR operator
bin(a|b);  

#Exclusive OR operator
bin(a^b);  


#Logical Operators
a=True;
b=False;
a and b;
a or b;
not a;
